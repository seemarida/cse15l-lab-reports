# Lab Report 3  
## Part 1  
**A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code**  
  ```
  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1, 2, 3}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
**An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code**  
```
@Test
  public void testReversedEven() {
    int[] input1 = {2,4,6,8};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{8,6,4,2}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
**The symptom, as the output of running the tests**

**The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it:**  
a) before  
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; I < arr.length; i +=1){
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
}
```

b) after  
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; I < arr.length / 2; i +=1){
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
}
```

**Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue:**  

To fix this bug, I adjusted the for loop by changing i < arr.length to i < arr.length / 2. The reason this fix worked, is that it prevented the array from being reversed twice, therefore giving the proper output.  

## Part 2  
**grep command**  
1. a) ```grep -E "chain" 1471-2091-2-10.txt```  
part of the output:
```

This command searches for lines that contain "chain" in the above file and displays those lines. This is useful because it allows us to quickly find information related to a certain keyword from a file we want without have to do it yourself and search through the entire file.  
b) ```grep -E "Qaeda" chapter-11.txt```  
part of the output:  
```

   I am searching for "chain" in the .txt file shown above, the output shows some of the lines from that text file that contain the term "chain". This is interesting because it allows you to quickly extract the information that you need rather than manually searching a large file. The command facilitates the efficient extraction of information related to the specified keyword, minimizing the effort required to manually search through the entire file.

3. a) ```grep -c chain biomed```  
output:
```grep: biomed: Is a directory```  
```0```
The -c option is used to count the number of lines that match the specified pattern. In this case, it's useful for getting a fast statistic on the frequency of the term "chain" in the directory.

b) ```grep -c Qaeda 911report```  
output:  
```grep: 911report: Is a directory```
```0```  

Using this command option is useful when you want to get a quick summary or a statistic about a frequently occurring pattern in your text file. This is interesting because it helps you quickly count the number of lines that correspond to a pattern, without outputting the actual lines, just the count.

3. a)```grep -l chain 1471-2091-2-10.txt```  

output:

```1471-2091-2-10.txt```  
The -l option is used to show only the names of files that have matching lines. This is useful when you want to determine files including a specific keyword without showing the actual matching lines.  
b)```grep -l Qaeda chapter-11.txt```  
output:  
```chapter-11.txt``` 

This command helps us quickly identify files that contain a keyword like "chain" in them. This is interesting because it shows us a list of filenames only and hides the matching lines.

4. a)```grep -v chain 1471-2091-2-10.txt```  

some of the output:  
```
Background
  The CD98 (4F2, FRP-1) molecule, a cell surface
  disulfide-linked heterodimer, was originally described as a
  T cell activation antigen [ 1 ] , and later was shown to
  provide a co-stimulatory signal for CD3-mediated T-cell
  activation [ 2 ] , independent of CD28/CD80/CD86
  interaction [ 3 ] . In other studies, triggering of human
  monocyte CD98 could suppress T cell proliferation [ 4 ] ,
  or promote homotypic cell aggregation of monocytes [ 5 ] .
  Also, CD98 may be a target antigen for natural killer cells
  [ 6 ] , may mediate fusion of blood monocytes leading to
  osteoclast formation [ 7 8 ] , and may modulate
  hematopoietic cell survival and differentiation [ 9 ] .
  The CD98 molecule is also widely expressed on rapidly
  growing non-hematopoietic cells, where it may modulate
  oncogenic transformation [ 10 11 ] , metal ion transport [
  12 13 ] , cell fusion [ 14 15 ] , and amino acid transport
  [ 16 17 18 19 ].
```

The -v option inverts the match, showing lines that do not contain the specified pattern. This is useful when you want to exclude certain lines from the output.  
        
b)```grep -v Qaeda chapter-11.txt```  
some of the output:  
```
FORESIGHT-AND HINDSIGHT
In composing this narrative, we have tried to remember that we write with the benefit
    and the handicap of hindsight. Hindsight can sometimes see the past clearly-with
    20/20 vision. But the path of what happened is so brightly lit that it places
    everything else more deeply into shadow. Commenting on Pearl Harbor, Roberta
    Wohlstetter found it "much easier after the event to sort the relevant from the
    irrelevant signals. After the event, of course, a signal is always crystal clear; we
    can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has occurred.
```

   This helps us identify things like errors in a hypothetical data set and helps clean your data to focus on relevant content, it does this by displaying all lines that do not contain the specified pattern we passed, then filters out the lines that match the pattern and shows everything else.
