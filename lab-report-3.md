# Lab Report 3  
## Part 1  
**A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code**  
  ```
  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1, 2, 3}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
**An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code**  
```
@Test
  public void testReversedEven() {
    int[] input1 = {2,4,6,8};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{8,6,4,2}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
**The symptom, as the output of running the tests**

**The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it:**

**Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue:**  
To fix this bug, I adjusted the for loop by changing i < arr.length to i < arr.length / 2. The reason this fix worked, is that it prevented the array from being reversed twice, therefore giving the proper output.
